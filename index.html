	<h1> If I listed all the things that make you so great, we would be here for at least 3 milleniumn, so I got a cheesy poem instead</h1>
	<h3>My dad's the best: better than all the rest! He's funny and kind, and has a smart mind. I love him very dearly and understand him clearly. He's a determined man, the type to drink (light) beer from a can, or maybe a bottle. The only thing that I dont understand is that when given the chance, HE CHOSES THE TOWER OVER DUNGEON, CASTLE, AND CONFLUX!</h3>
